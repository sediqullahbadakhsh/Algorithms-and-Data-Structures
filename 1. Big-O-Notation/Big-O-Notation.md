### Need for Big O Notation

Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches, when debugging code identifying inefficient parts and find pain points in applications.

### Big O

is a way to formalize fuzzy counting.
it allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow.
