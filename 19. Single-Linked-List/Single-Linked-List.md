# Single Linked List

## Objectives

- What is Linked List
- Linked Lists VS Arrays
- Insertion, Removal, and traversal methods

## Definition

A data structure that contains a `head`, `tail` and `length` property
Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.

## Linked Lists VS Arrays

### Lists

- do not have indexes
- connected via nodes with a next pointer
- random access is not allowed

### Arrays

- indexed in order
- insertion and deletion can be expensive
  can quickly be accessed at a specific index
