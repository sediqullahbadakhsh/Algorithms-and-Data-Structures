# Data Structures

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
like: stack, queue, BTS, linkedlist...

## Implementing them

to implement Datastructure we use ES2015 Class syntax

### Static methods

the `static` keyword defines a static method for a class. static methodes are called without instantiating their class and cannot be called through a class instance. static methods are often used to create utility functions for an application.
